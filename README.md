# Nerf-da-Jetpack-Space-Engineer-Mod
Here the github repository for my slightly changed version of a mod for space engineers

This is the Description on the Steam Workshop:
Hey Engineers!
My friend has a death warrant out for the vanilla jetpack so I decided to quench his thirst for blood by doing a slight adaptation of Redo's RedoJetpackNerf

**Original Description:**
Makes the jetpack a bit less OP in survival.
Reduces thrust to 2000N; it was originally 3200N.
Reduces hydrogen efficiency to 0.2x default.
Reduces dampener strength multiplier to 1; it was originally 5 (holy crap).
Reduced thrust can be very annoying in creative on planets, since it's barely enough to fly.
Works with the female engineer.

**My Changes:**
Changed hydrogen efficiency to 1x default because it was causing issues with refueling midair.

Otherwise unchanged, enjoy :)
